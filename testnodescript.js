#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("hello node scripts world!");
// FYI: Setting `node` in first line to some other executable works too.., for e.g.,setting `notepad ` intead will open this file with notepad, yikes!
// FYI: Seting `node` to vim wil make executing this file execute via vim.
// FYI: Use `/usr/bin/env.exe --help` to get help what is this executable(interesting though, works in windows too..).
